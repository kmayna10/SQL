# Example query set (PostgreSQL)

#Exercise 1. Alias tables to shorter length. Join the two tables (netflix_people as people and netflix_titles_info as titles),
From this join, I use the show id, which is a shared value, to join the two tables.
Then, I am able to query from this join the show_id, director (both from people table) and the title and type (both from the titles table).

SELECT 
people.show_id,
people.director
titles.title
titles.type
FROM "netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id=titles.show_id;

#Exercise 2. How many movies are in this database? 
In this exercise, I query netflix_title_info for values where the type is movie? Not TV shows or other, but Movies?
Answer: Number of Movies: 6131

SELECT COUNT (*) FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

#Exercise 3. When was the most recent batch of shows added to the database?
In this exercise, I will need to isolate the column "date_added" from the table "netflix_titles_info"
To do this, I need to find the most recent, or maximum date value in this column.
Answer: Most recent addition was 2021-09-25 00:00:00

SELECT MAX (date_added)
FROM "netflix_titles_info";

#Exercise 4. Order the titles in alphabetical order.
To do this, I simply select the titles from the “netflix_titles_info” and place them in ascending order. 
An interesting (but unsurprising) result is the discovery that in these results, there are several shows that begin with a #, followed by all shows with numeric titles, then they continue in traditional alphabetic order (A-Z).

SELECT title
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

#Exercise 5. Who is the director for the movie “Across the Universe”? 
This query required that I join the two tables, using their shared show_id. By using a left join, I selected the director where the title of the film was “Across the Universe”. 
Answer: Julie Taymor

SELECT director
FROM "netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Across the Universe';

— Exercise 6. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
— This was a straightforward query wherein I pulled from only the netflix_titles_info table. I limited by selection to movies, and put these in ascending order. I then limited the results to see the 10 oldest. 
— The reason I did not simply limit my query to 1 is that I wanted to be certain I was not just getting one result when there may have been several from that year.
— Answer: Prelude to War, 1942
SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 10;
